Expressions-2:

    Operator precedence:
        -Highest precedence to the lowest=>
            1- Parentheses
            2- Exponention
            3- Multiplication, Division and Remainder
            4- Addition and Subtraction
            5- Left to Right

    Types in Python:
        - When Python evaluating expressions it is not only looking for the value but also the type
        - if you try to use unsuitable types together then Python will give you what's called "TypeError" exception
        - you can learn type of the constant by using "type(your constant)" keyword
        - floating points(e.g. 1.2) have more range but they are less precise. In integers this is opposite.
        Type Conversion:    
            - when you add up an integer with a floating point you forcibly convert the result to a floating point
            - you can manipulate types by using certain keywords(e.g. float() or int())
            - you can convert a string to an integer or floating point as long as it written as digits
    
    User Input:
        - we can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user input using "input()" keyword
        - the data taken from user input returned as string by default(you can convert that with certain keywords)
        - when you use "print()" keyword every comma between string elements adds a space to the output
