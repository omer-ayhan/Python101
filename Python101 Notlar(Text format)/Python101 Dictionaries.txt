Dictionaries:
    - despite not being same as the lists, it has many features that have great uses
    - unlike lists a dictionary has to be in key-value pair. This means every value in dictionary has to have a label. This is called "associative array" in most of the programming languages
    - dictionaries are unordered which makes index numbers useless for them(still kinda can be used) 
    - if you want to use a value inside dictionary, you have to call it using that value's key name
    - empty dictionaries can be created by using "dict()" function
    - you can assign a key and a value to a dictionary even after creating it. And that shows the lists and dictionaries are mutable
    - in Dictionaries if you lookup something that doesn't exist you will get a traceback
    - keys inside dictionaries can be checked with "in" keyword
    "get(keyname, default value)" method:
        - checks if specified key exists in the dictionary and returns that key's value
        - when specified key not found it returns the default value
