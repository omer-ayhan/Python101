 Python Notes:

 Expressions:
    Constants:
        - Fixed values(strings, numbers, letters, etc.)
        - Reserved words(which cannot be used as variable names)
        - variables(allocates memory for your variable)

    Variable Naming Rules:
        - must start with a letter or underscore
        - cannot consist characters other than letters, numbers or some exceptional symbols
        - python is a case sensitive language(which means you cannot change any character of the variable name)
        Mnemonic:
            - a naming method which explains logic of the code to help the developer who is looking to the code
    
    Assignment Statements:
        Assigning to a variable:
            - "x = 4 + 4" this shows when the process of the right side is done then it stores the result on left side to let it be allocated in the memory 
        Reassigning to a variable:
            - if x was assigned before you still can reassign it again with a similar process to have a new output which also overrides old value
