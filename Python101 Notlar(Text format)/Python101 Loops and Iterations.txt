Loops and Iterations:
    - Loops are basically a repeating process that keeps going until given conditions are met
    - if the condition of the loop statys true all the time then the loop will go forever. Which is called "Infinite loop"
    - if a loop's condition is false from start hence it doesn't let the loop to execute. Then it is called "zero trip loop"
    "break" statement:
        - whenever this statement gets executed inside a loop it stops the loop and jumps out of it
    
    "continue" statement:
        - this statement skips the current value(doesn't return it) and goes to next iteration in loop but it doesn't stop the execution of that loop
    
    "for" loops:
        - a simple way to create indefinite(iterating through a collection of values) loops
        - you have to use an iterable value(string, list, etc.) in order to execute the loop
        - body of the loop executed once for each value
        - the iteration variable passes through all of the values in the iterable collection
    "is" operator:
        - a logical operator similar to "==" operator but stronger.

    "is not" operator:
        - Similar to "is" except it can be used instead of "!=" operator

    - you shouldn't be using "is" when you are using "==" because it has stronger precedence you might have some issues. Also similar thing applies to "is not"
    - "is"/"is not" usually used for True, False or None conditional expressions
