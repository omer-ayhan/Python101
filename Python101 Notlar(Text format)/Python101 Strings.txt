Strings:
    - strings can be concatinated with each other
    - you can use some of the logical operators on strings(e.g. "==",">","<")
    "in" keyword:
        - even though it can often be seen in for loops it also has other uses. For example; you can check if a string can be found inside another string(same thing for lists)
    
    - strings have many methods that you can do lots of things with them. You can see all of the methods by writing "dir(any string)" or you can look in documentation
    - you can use ".capitalize()" method for capitalizing first letters
    - ".find(string)" method gives the index number of found letter(returns the index of first one it found even though there is another of it later)  
    - ".replace(old string, new string)" can be used to replace current string/strings to a new one you specified 
    - ".strip()" removes whitespaces in string from beginning and ending
    - ".lstrip()" removes whitespaces only from beginning 
    - ".rstrip()" removes whitespaces only from ending
    - ".startswith(specified string)" returns True or False depending on desired line starts with specified string 
    - ".split(split value)" as the name suggests it splits the string according to the split value and returns it as a list. Also if you leave split value empty then the split value will be assigned as empty spaces by default
